# minesweeper
I implemented an AI that plays Minesweeper using logical reasoning. It represents knowledge as {cells} = count sentences and infers safe cells or mines through logical deduction and subset inference. Demonstrates knowledge-based AI, propositional reasoning, and intelligent decision-making under uncertainty.
